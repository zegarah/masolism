# Masolism
Masolism will be a powerfull network out of wholey open source Soft- and Hardware.
I want to design and build a "Server Tablet". Basically a Server with integrated Touch display and a custom operating system.
The operating system should be based on Linux.
With that Server Tablet I want to design a "Client Handy". That should be a own designed and build mobile device, with around 30GiB of Storage and 4GiB RAM.
The Client Handy should be capeable of running two seperate operating systems. The first will be a custom android, the second one a nativ resever of the contents the Server Tablet gives it.


The Server Tablett as well as the Client Handy must be capable of being an i2P Router, for them communicating only over the i2P network, therefor being completely anonymous and supporting the i2P net.


Every Server Tablet should also be capeable of running a homeserver, remote desktop and be fully modular for hardware upgrades.


The Client Handy must also be fully customizeable, running a 'degoogled' custom Android and a custom Client App to reseve a remote desktop from the Server Tablet, as well as Documents and other SaaS.
